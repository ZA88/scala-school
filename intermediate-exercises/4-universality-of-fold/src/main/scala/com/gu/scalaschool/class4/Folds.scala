  /** You're probably finding this a little repetitive now. We can express all of the above in terms of a fold.
    *
    * To fold up a list you start off with some initial value. You then look at the leftmost value of the list, combine
    * that with your current value in some useful way (for a sum, for example, you would add them together), and that
    * becomes your new value. You keep doing that until the list is empty, at which point you've got your answer.
    *
    * e.g.
    *
    * You want to sum the list 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: Nil.
    *
    * As we're adding up the numbers we're going to start with 0.
    *
    * We then consider the first number in the list - 1 + 0 == 1.
    *
    * At that point we have the remainder:
    *
    * 2 :: 3 :: Nil.
    *
    * We consider the next value in the list - 2 + 1 == 3.
    *
    * Now we have the remainder:
    *
    * 3 :: Nil.
    *
    * Then the 3 finally:
    *
    * 3 + 3 == 6.
    *
    * OK, we've folded up the list.
    *
    * I want you to fill in fold below. The type signature might be a little scary, but there are examples below of the
    * above functions defined as a fold, which should guide you a little bit as to what it is going on.

      * number of an empty list is here, so we throw an error.
